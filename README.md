# README 
In this repository, the notebook `Analysis.ipynb` computes the numbers for the evaluation section of my bachelor thesis.
Also, the `Merge.ipynb` explains the merging and enrichment logic that is incorporated into the CLI `merger` tool. 
The code was written with replicability in mind. Therefore, it is not necessary to run an instance of Aleph along with the scripts.
