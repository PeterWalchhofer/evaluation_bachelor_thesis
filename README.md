# README 
In this repository the notebook (`Analysis.ipynb`), which computes the numbers of the evaluation section of my bachelor thesis, can be found. 
Also, the `Merge.ipynb` explains the merging logic that is incorporated into the CLI tool `wd_merger.py`.
The code was written with replicability in mind. Therefore, it is not necessary to run an instance of Aleph along with the scripts.
